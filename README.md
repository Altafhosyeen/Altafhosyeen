# 👋 Hi, I'm Altaf Hosyeen (@Altafhosyeen)

👀 **About Me:**  
I'm a passionate and dedicated Front-End Developer specializing in **React.js**. With over 2 years of hands-on experience, I've built a variety of dynamic and responsive web applications using modern web technologies. My work focuses on creating seamless user experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code.

🌱 **Currently Learning:**  
I’m always eager to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest trends in web development. Right now, I’m diving deeper into advanced React patterns, TypeScript, and exploring state management libraries like Recoil and Zustand. I'm also sharpening my knowledge of back-end technologies to become a more well-rounded developer.

💞️ **Looking to Collaborate On:**  
I'm open to collaborating on projects that involve **React.js** and **TypeScript** or those that push the boundaries of front-end development. Whether it's building a new feature-rich web app, improving existing codebases, or exploring innovative UI/UX solutions, I'm excited to contribute and learn from other developers.
